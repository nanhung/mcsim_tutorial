# Uncertainty in Risk Analysis

The objective of a **probabilistic risk analysis** is the quantification of risk from made man-made and natural activities ([Vesely and Rasmuson, 1984](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6924.1984.tb00950.x)).  

Two major types of uncertainty need to be differentiated:

### (1) Uncertainty due to physical variability

### (2) Uncertainty due to lack of knowledge in

- Modeling uncertainty

- Parameter uncertainty

- Completeness uncertainty

---

# Uncertainty in modeling

### Deterministic Simulation

- Define exposure unit & calculate point estimate

### 1-D Monte Carlo Simulation: Uncertainty

- Identify probability distributions to simulate probabilistic outputs

### 2-D Monte Carlo Simulation: Uncertainty & Variability

- Bayesian statistics to characterize population uncertainty and variability

# Uncertainty in parameter

- **The parameter** is an element of a system that determine the model output. 

- **Parameter uncertainty** comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the mathematical model but whose exact values are unknown and cannot be controlled in physical experiments. 

$$y = f(x_i) $$

# Simulation in GNU MCSim

## Monte Carlo simulations

- Perform repeated (stochastic) simulations across a randomly sampled region of the model parameter space.

Used to: Check possible simulation (under given parameter distributions) results before model calibration

</br>

## SetPoints simulation

- Solves the model for a series of specified parameter sets. You can create these parameter sets yourself or use the output of a previous Monte Carlo or MCMC simulation.

Used to: Posterior analysis, Local/global sensitivity analysis

---

# MonteCarlo()

The MonteCarlo specification gives general information required for the runs: (1) the output file name, (2) the number of runs to perform, and (3) a starting seed for the random number generator. Its syntax is:

```r
MonteCarlo("<OutputFilename>", <nRuns>, <RandomSeed>);
```

- `"<OutputFilename>"` The character string <OutputFilename>, enclosed in double quotes, should be a valid filename for your operating system. 

- `<nRuns>` The number of runs <nRuns> should be an integer, and is only limited by either your storage space for the output file or the largest (long) integer available on your machine. 

- `<RandomSeed>` The seed <RandomSeed> of the pseudo-random number generator can be any positive integer (including zero). 

Here is an example of use:

```r
MonteCarlo("simmc.out", 50000, 9386);
```

---

# Distrib()

The specification of distributions for simple Monte Carlo simulations,

```r
Distrib(<parameter identifier>, <distribution-name>, [<shape parameters>]);
```

.font90[

Here are some examples:

`LogUniform`, with two shape parameters: the minimum and the maximum of the sampling range in natural space. 

`Uniform`, with two shape parameters: the minimum and the maximum of the sampling range. 

`Normal_cv,` is the normal distribution with the coefficient of variation instead of the standard deviation as second parameter. 

`Normal_v,` is also the normal distribution with the variance instead of the standard deviation as second parameter. 

`LogNormal` takes two reals numbers as parameters: the geometric mean and the geometric standard deviation. 

`TruncNormal` (truncated normal distribution), takes four real parameters: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum and the maximum. 

]

---

# Example

```r
## ./mcsim.one.model.R.exe one.mtc.in.R ####
## Monte Carlo simulation input file for one compartment model

MonteCarlo ("simmc.out", 10, 95814);

Distrib (Ka,  Uniform, 0.2,    0.8);
Distrib (Ke,  Uniform, 0.03,   0.1);

Simulation { # 1
  OralDose = 100; 
  BW = 60;
  PrintStep (C_central, 0, 8, 1);
}

End.
```

---

# SetPoints()

This command specifies an output filename, the name of a text file containing (1) the chosen parameter values, (2) the number of simulations to perform and (3) a list of model parameters to read in. It has the following syntax:

```r
SetPoints("<OutputFilename>", "<SetPointsFilename>", <nRuns>, 
            <parameter identifier>, <parameter identifier>, ...);
```

- `"<OutputFilename>"` The character string <OutputFilename>, enclosed in double quotes.

- `"<SetPointsFilename>"` The character string <SetPointsFilename>, enclosed in double quotes.

- `<nRuns>` should be less or equal to the number of lines (minus one) in the set points file. If a zero is given, all lines of the file are read. 

- `<parameter identifier>` a comma-separated list of the parameters or vectors to be read in the SetPointsFilename. 

---

# Example

```r
## ./mcsim.one.model.R.exe one.setpt.in.R ####
## Setpoint simulation input file for one compartment model
## Use "sim.out" that generated from "one.mtc.in.R"

SetPoints ("setpts.out", "simmc.out", 0, Ka, Ke);

Simulation { # 1
  OralDose = 100; 
  BW = 60;
  PrintStep (C_central, 0, 8, 1);
}

End.
```

# Why we need SA?

### Parameter Prioritization

- Identify the most important factors

- Adjust the uncertainty in the model response in experiment design

### Parameter Fixing

- Identify the least important factors

- Simplify the model if it has too many factors

### Parameter Mapping

- Identify critical regions of the inputs that are responsible for extreme values of the model response

# Classification of SA Methods

.footnote[http://evelynegroen.github.io]

.pull-left[

**Local** (One-at-a-time)

<img src="http://evelynegroen.github.io/assets/images/fig11local.jpg" height="240px" />

**"Local"** SA focus on sensitivity at a particular set of input parameters, usually using gradients or partial derivatives

]


???
Usually, some people have experience in modeling they have the knowledge in local sensitivity analysis. 

This method is very simple. You move one parameter and fix other parameters then check the change of model outputs. 

On the other side, some researcher also developed the approach that moves all parameters at a time and checks the change of model output. We call it Global sensitivity analysis or variance-based sensitivity analysis.

# Sensitivity indeices

.font120[First order] $(S_i)$

- The output variance contributed by the specific parameter $x_i$,  
also known as .bolder[main effect]

.font120[Interaction] $(S_{ij})$

- The output variance contributed by any non-identical pair of input parameters

.font120[Total order] $(S_{T})$

- The output variance contributed by the specific parameter and interaction,  
also known as .bolder[total effect]


<hr/>

.left[
**“Local”** SA usually only addresses first order effects

**“Global”** SA can address total effect that include main effect and interaction

# Morris Elementary Effects Screening

- A simple but effective way of screening a few important input factors ([Morris 1991](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.1991.10484804)).

- Perform parameter sampling in **Latin Hypercube** following "One-Step-At-A-Time"

- Can compute the importance $(\mu^*)$ and interaction $(\sigma)$ of the effects

$$\left[ \begin{array}{lllllll}{1} & {0} & {0} & {0} & {0} & {\ldots} & {0} \\ {1} & {1} & {0} & {0} & {0} & {\ldots} & {0} \\ {1} & {1} & {1} & {0} & {0} & {\ldots} & {0} \\ {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {0} & {\ldots} & {0} \\ {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {\ldots} & {0} \\ {\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\vdots} & {\ddots} & {\vdots} \\ {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {\ldots} & {1}\end{array}\right] \left( \begin{array}{c}{b_{0}} \\ {b_{1}} \\ {\vdots} \\ {b_{k}}\end{array}\right)=\left( \begin{array}{c}{y_{1}} \\ {y_{2}} \\ {\vdots} \\ {y_{k+1}}\end{array}\right)$$

# Variance-Based Method

- Variance-based method for sensitivity analysis were first employed by chemists ([Cukier et al. 1973](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/59/8/10.1063/1.1680571)). The method, known as **FAST** (Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test). 

- Robust in **factor fixing**, but had relatively high computational cost than local SA.

### Main effect

$$S_{i}=\frac{V\left[E\left(Y | X_{i}\right)\right]}{V(Y)}$$

</br>

### Total effect
Example of parameter 1 for model with three parameters

$$S_{T 1}=S_{1}+S_{12}+S_{13}+S_{123}$$

$$S_{1}+ S_2 + S_{3} + S_{12}+S_{13} + S_{23} + S_{123} = 1$$

---

# Steps to performing sensitivity analysis

1. Identify all model factor $(x_i)$ which should be consider in analysis

2. Characterise the uncertainty for each selected input factor

3. Generate a sample of a given size from the previously defined probability distribution

4. Define the variable of interest $(y_{i,t})$

5. Execute the model for each combination of factor

6. **Visualize and interpret the outputs**

7. Estimate the sensitivity measures ("*check convergence*")

8. Decision making

---

# R package sensitivity

A collection of functions for factor screening, global sensitivity analysis and reliability sensitivity analysis. Most of the functions have to be applied on model with scalar output, but several functions support multi-dimensional outputs.

```{r}
ls(pos = "package:sensitivity")
```

$$f(\mathbf{x})=\sin \left(x_{1}\right)+a \sin ^{2}\left(x_{2}\right)+b x_{3}^{4} \sin \left(x_{1}\right)$$

# Final thoughts

- If model evaluation is computationally burdensome, use the **Morris** method as an initial screen to remove clearly “non-influential” parameters ([Hsieh et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.00588/full))

- Use the lower error tolerance value to solve the problem in computational error.

- Always plot the data. Make sure you do not make any mistake in parameter sampling.

- Be aware of the parameter uncertainty. If the sampling range is too broad, try using the log-transformed distribution.

- Try Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC). The QMC method can generate more "uniform" distribution than random MC sampling.

- Making sure to check convergence ([Sarrazin et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216300251?via%3Dihub))
